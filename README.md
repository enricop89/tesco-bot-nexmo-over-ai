## Introduction

Where is the closest Tesco supermarket? What are the tea brands sold at Tesco? 

If you ever lived in the UK, you would have liked someone to ask the above questions. What if you can do it via WhatsApp?

This blog post will help you integrating **Tesco API** with **Nexmo Messages API** and **Over AI Bot**.

## Getting started


Before you begin you'll need to install the Serverless Framework

### Serverless 

You can install the [Serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started#installing-via-npm) framework directly from npm

```
# Install the serverless cli
npm install -g serverless

# Or, update the serverless cli from a previous version
npm update -g serverless

```

#### Serverless YML






### Conclusion

So what did we learn in this post?

We created an integration between OverAI bot and Nexmo Messages (WhatsApp). 
We created three main intents and pull data from an external API (Tesco API) to enable the bot to reply with additional information.

This flow can be implemented and integrated with any external API so the use cases are infinite!
